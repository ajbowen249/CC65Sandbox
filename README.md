# CC65 Sandbox

This is a project meant for playing around with [CC65](https://github.com/cc65/cc65), a multi-platform 6502-family compiler.

## Structure

- Most experiments will live in their own (orphaned) branches in the repo.
- Most branches probably compile for the Commodore 64.
- Most branches should compile with `make`, producing a file with the name of the parent folder (most likely `CC65Sandbox.c64`)

## Other Tools
Other than CC65, some tools used in creating these projects include:
- [Spritemate](http://www.spritemate.com/), a simple in-browser sprite editor for the Commodore 64.

## Master Branch
The master branch has the state of the sandbox as of its initial upload to GitHub, and currently when run will show a basic animated sprite traversing the screen.
